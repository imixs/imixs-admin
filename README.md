# Imixs-Admin

The Imixs-Admin project provides a web based administration tool to manage an [Imixs-Workflow](https://www.imixs.org) instance.  
Imixs-Admin connects to a running Imixs-Workflow instance via the Imixs-Rest API.

Learn more about the Imixs-Admin Tool on the [Imixs Workflow Project Site](https://www.imixs.org/doc/administration.html).

## Run with Docker

The Imixs-Admin client provides a Docker Image to be used to run the service in any Docker environment or in a Kubernetes cluster. 
The docker image is available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/imixs/imixs-admin). 

You can start the latest version of the Imixs-Admin Tool in a docker container running:

	$ docker run --rm --name="wildfly" -it \
			-p 8080:8080 \
			-e WILDFLY_PASS="adminadmin" \
			imixs/wildfly

...and load the Imixs-Admin client from your browser

	http://localhost:8080/


### Insecure SSL Connections

The initialization of a secure JAX-RS / HTTPs connection from the Imixs-Admin client to a Imixs-Workflow instance can fail caused by the lack of a certificate in Java's keystore. A certificate import into the java keystore fixes the problem in most cases. But for development or for system tests, however, a certificate verification is not required and can be omitted. To accept insecure SSL connections the environment variable IMIXS_REST_CLIENT_INSECURE can be set to 'true':

	IMIXS_REST_CLIENT_INSECURE=true

In this mode, the Imixs-Rest Client will install a custom SSL TrustManager that accepts insecure SSL connections.

**Note:** This feature should only be used in dev and test environments!

# Development

Imixs-Admin runs as a self-contained microservice with a modern Web UI based on Jakarta EE Faces 4.0. The client interacts with the Imxis-Workflow Engine via the Imixs-Rest API and the [Imixs-Melman library](https://github.com/imixs/imixs-melman). You can adapt or extend the project if needed.

Imixs-Admin is based on Jakarta EE 10 and Wildfly Version 27.0.0. To build the imixs-admin client manually from sources run the maven command:

	$ mvn clean install

The .war file can be deployed into any Jakarta EE Application server.

## Build the Docker Image

To build the imixs-admin Docker image manually run:

	$ mvn clean install -Pdocker

To start it from your local docker environment:

	$ docker-compose up

## Changing the RootContext

The Imixs-Admin client is installed per default into the root context "/". You can change the root context by changing teh glassfish-web.xml file. The following example set the root-context to "/dev/": 

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<!DOCTYPE glassfish-web-app PUBLIC "-//GlassFish.org//DTD GlassFish Application Server 3.1 Servlet 3.0//EN"
	   "http://glassfish.org/dtds/glassfish-web-app_3_0-1.dtd">
	<glassfish-web-app>
		<context-root>/dev/</context-root>
	</glassfish-web-app>


## The Maven 'wildfly' Profile

During development you can use the docker-compose-dev.yml file. This stack contains a sample application and the Imixs-Admin tool. The deployment is  maped to the docker/deployments folder to the wildfly auto deploy directory. 

	$ mvn clean install -Pwildfly
	$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
	
you may have to grant the deployment folder first to allow the docker non privileged user to access this location.

	$ sudo chmod 777 docker/deployments/

In this mode the deployment directory for wildfly is mapped to '~/git/imixs-admin/src/docker/deployments'

To build the Docker image directly from the Dockerfile run:

	docker build --tag=imixs/wildfly .
